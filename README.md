Description
-----------

The storage tracker application has the following main features:

1. Record changes to the file-system using [inotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify)
2. Report these changes to the user as a graph showing usage over time
3. Search the recorded changes with file name

Only the primary external storage device is supported as of now. There is a plan to extend to all
available storage devices as exposed by Android framework.
Allow a day or two after installing the app for it collect some data to display.
